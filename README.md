This project implements an automated Bitcoin price tracking system using Unix shell scripting, SQLite, cron scheduling, and Gnuplot visualization. It collects Bitcoin price data at regular intervals, validates the HTML response, extracts the price, and stores the results in an SQLite database. Errors such as malformed HTML, missing values, or failed database inserts are handled gracefully and logged for debugging, while successful runs are recorded separately.

The system stores all data in a normalized SQLite table named price_history, which includes fields for price, 24-hour low and high placeholders, average price, and the timestamp. Automation is achieved through cron, which executes the scraper every hour and logs the output for reliability. Additional export scripts allow users to retrieve either the full dataset or only the last seven days of records for analysis.

Data visualization is performed through a dedicated plotting script that generates ten analytical graphs stored in the plots/ directory, covering trends, comparisons, and correlations. The entire project is organised into a structured directory containing all scripts, data files, logs, and plot outputs. Git version control is used throughout development, with iterative commits and a clean repository, fulfilling the requirements for COMP1314 Data Management.
